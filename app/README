Application: GYM4U

Creators: Justine Estrada, Anna Kovneva, Joe Zanini

Register:

When registering there is a spinner that gives options for a few gym's. However, we only implemented
this project for Dynamic so right now that is the Gym that you can select that will have the app run
properly.

Heart Rate Activity:

Our app can be ran on an emulator but the heart rate activity may crash if opened in the emulator
since it will not be able to access the flashlight needed to run the activity. The heart rate activity
can be ran on any android device.

Your Profile activity:

The gym coordinates are hardcoded to match Dynamic's coordinates if you are using the emulator to test
this portion just push (37.711780,-121.000549) into the emulator's location and it will begin the timer.
Then when you want to end the timer just change the coordinates. There are log statements under the tag
"gpsStuff" that will confirm when the timer is started and stopped.
